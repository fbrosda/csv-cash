#+title: CSV Cash
#+author: Fabian Brosda

This is a very small helper page, to write done your cash expenses on your
phone, while not at home.  The records are stored in a csv file, which is
intended for import into [[https://gnucash.org/][GNUCash]] later on.

* Installation
- Required are PHP and some web server
- Add the files in [[file:public/][public]] to the server
- Make sure the created ~data~ directory is writable by the process your
  web-server is executed in
- Make the page accessible

Now all cash expenses can be written down with minimal effort.

* Improvements
- [X] Auto completion for description and amount
- [ ] Add offline support
